## About the project
Santuário Voz Animal is an animal protection institution in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, that shelters rescued or abandoned animals and only exists because of the work of dozens of volunteers and financial aid from donators.
There are over 300 animals: cats, dogs, horses, cows, pigs, poultry and one sheep, Dolly.
